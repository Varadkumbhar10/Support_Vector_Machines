Title:COVID-19 Detection Using Support Vector Machines (SVM) on Chest CT Scan Images

This project focuses on using the Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithm for binary classification to detect whether a chest CT scan image is indicative of COVID-19 infection or not. SVM is a powerful machine learning technique widely used for image classification tasks.


The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of early and accurate detection of the virus. Chest CT scan images have been used to aid in the diagnosis of COVID-19. Machine learning techniques, such as SVM, can be applied to automatically classify these images as either indicative of COVID-19 infection or not.

In this project, we will build an SVM-based classifier that can analyze chest CT scan images and make binary predictions regarding COVID-19 infection.
